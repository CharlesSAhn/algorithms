What is a binary search tree, and how does it differ from other tree data structures?
- Each node has at most two child nodes, referred to as the left and right subtrees. 
- The value of each node is greater than or equal to the values in its left subtree and less 
  than or equal to the values in its right subtree.
- Search, insertion, and deletion operations = O(log n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- Compared to other tree data structures, such as general trees, binary search trees have the advantage 
  of faster search and modification operations. 
- However, binary search trees require that the input data be in a specific order, and they may become 
  unbalanced if the data is already sorted or if the insertion and deletion operations are not 
  carefully managed. To overcome this issue, variants of binary search trees have been developed, 
  such as AVL trees and Red-Black trees, which guarantee balanced trees and improve their 
  worst-case time complexity.
